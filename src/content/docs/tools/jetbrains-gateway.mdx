## Features

Now that you have established the connection between your Daytona installation and JetBrains Gateway, you can navigate to Daytona's configuration page by clicking on the `Connect` button under Daytona on welcome page. In this section, we will walk you through the features of Daytona's JetBrains Gateway Plugin, including how to create, manage, and use your [workspace](/usage/workspaces), how to manage team, profile information and more.

### Creating workspaces

Each [workspace](/usage/workspaces) created on Daytona are isolated in their own environment, even if they came from the same repository. In the following two sub-sections, we will talk about how to create and manage your workspaces with Daytona in JetBrains Gateway. Workspaces created within the Jetbrains Gateway via Daytona plugin are synced with your Daytona installation. 

{/*TODO: Second tier ordered list font colors are not correct, this spacing error will disappear if this comment is removed*/}

- **Create a workspace**: 
Within the Daytona configuration screen in Jetbrains Gateway (the screen that shows up after you click on `Connect to Daytona` on the welcome screen), there are two ways to create a workspaces:

- 1. **Create via repository URL**: Under the field `or enter a public repository URL`, you can paste in a repository you have access to, be it a public repository or private repository you owned. Then click on `New Workspace` to create a workspace.

- 2. **Create via dropdown menu**: On the right side of the field `Repository:`, click on the dropdown menu and select a repository, then click on `New Workspace` to create a workspace. Note that <u>it might take a couple seconds to create and start a workspace until it is loaded, appear under `Recent Workspaces`</u>. If you click on it multiple times while the workspace is creating, or starting, you might <u>accidentally create multiple workspace</u> with the same repository.


### Managing workspaces

- **Checking workspaces**: Workspaces that have been created on your Daytona dashboard will show up on the Daytona configuration screen under the section `Recent workspaces` with their status (whether it is started, creating or stopped). If a workspace has been started, the <Icon icon="jetbrains-circle" class="icon-display" />will be lighted up on the left side of the worksace, you can see the workspace with `started xxx time ago`. 

- **Pinning a workspace**: You can also pinned the workspace(by clicking on the <Icon icon="jetbrains-pin" class="icon-display rotate-30" size="1.2rem"/> button) if you have a lot of workspaces being created, and you want to keep them visible on the configuration screen. 

- **Opening workspaces**: On the Daytona configuration screen, you can click on a workspace's name that has been created (the ones under `Recent workspace`) to open a workspace, or you can open it by clicking on `Open` (after clicking on <Icon icon="jetbrains-dots" class="icon-display" /> button).

- **Stopping workspaces**: To stop a workspace, you can click on <Icon icon="jetbrains-dots" class="icon-display"/> and then click on `Stop`. Once a workspace is stopped, you can always bring it back clicking on the `Open` button on the dropdown menu. 


:::caution
- **Destroying a workspace**: This action is irreversible. Once you destroy it, you will lose all the installation and previous environment setup, unless you have them specified in `.devcontainer.json`. You can do so by clicking on the <Icon icon="jetbrains-dots" class="icon-display" /> button on the selected workspace and select `Destroy`.
:::

- **Granting access to organisation access**: Organization members can always request that an owner approve access to organization resources for Daytona, and organization owners receive notification of pending requests. For further information, check [here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/requesting-organization-approval-for-oauth-apps). 


### Managing profiles

Different profiles are equivalent to different Daytona installation, which might belong to your organisation, or your personal installation, identifiable by your Daytona URL. Profile related configuration is located next to `Profile:` on Jetbrains Gateway's Daytona configuration screen. 

- **Checking profiles**: Next to the `Profiles:`, click on the dropdown menu, you will see all your available profiles. Note that workspaces are correlated to your Daytona installation(aka profile), if you switch your profile you won't see the same workspace on previous selected profile. 

- **Adding a profile**: Click on the <Icon icon="jetbrains-add-profile" class="icon-display"/> button next to the <Icon icon="jetbrains-edit" class="icon-display"/>
