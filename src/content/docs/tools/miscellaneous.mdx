{/* TODO: Expand the introduction paragraph as more features introduce*/}
Other than useful features like managing [workspaces](/usage/workspaces), installing Daytona on a [cluster](/installation/cluster), monitoring via [telemetry](/administration/telemetry) and integrations with different IDEs including [VS Code](/tools/vs-code-extension) and [Jetbrains products](/tools/jetbrains-gateway), Daytona also offers a number of add-on features when you are working in an IDE. This section will discuss useful features that Daytona offers, regardless which IDEs you are using.

You could create a shareable live preview link when a forwarded port is opened.

## Live preview link



If you happened to be working on a website or webapp that you need open live preview in the browser while developing, you need to access the port on a target environment by port forwarding. You will also be able to share a live preview link for others to view changes. This section will introduce how you can do so.

:::note
This feature currently doesn't support webhook consumption.

### Opening ports 

When an application has a local development server, which is usually spun up by running `npm run dev` or `pnpm run dev` within the terminal of IDEs, a port will open for yourself to preview locally via an URL like `https://localhost:<port-number>` or `https://127.0.0.1:<port-number>`


 

##### How it is displayed in different IDEs

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="VS Code">
    At the bottom right corner, you will see a pop up window:
  
      <VscodeNotification/>

    - Clicking on `Open in Browser` button will open the local development URL in your default browser.
    - Clicking on `Preview in Editor` button will open the live preview in VS Code.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Theia">

    At the bottom right corner, you will see a pop up window:
  
      <TheiaNotification />

    - Clicking on `Open Preview` will open the live preview on the right side within the IDE, although the URL being opened will be a shareable link which you can send to your colleagues or others to preview.
    - Clicking on `Open Browser` will open the live preview in another tab in your default browser, and the URL will also be shareable.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Jetbrains(Webstorm)">

  - **Open terminal**: To forward a port on Jetbrains IDE, you will need to open the terminal, by clicking on the terminal icon  on the bottom left corner, or by using the shortcut: 

    - Windows: `Alt + F12`
    - Mac: `Ctrl + ~`

  - **Click on `<port-number>`**: Once the port is opened by running `npm run dev`, or `pnpm run dev`, you will see the port number being displayed on top of the terminal, and you can click on the port number to open a dropdown menu:

      <JetbrainsPortForwarding />

  - **Forward Port and Open Browser**: Clicking on `Forward Port and Open Browser` will open the live preview in your default browser. 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Shareable link

When a port is opened, you will be able to share a live preview link with others to view the changes you made.
