Daytona's VS Code extension integrates Visual Studio Code, appearing as a tab on the left-hand side alongside your default tabs in VS Code like File Explorer, Search, Source Control, etc, to streamline your workflow and boost productivity.

The extension allows you to have a frictionless experience of opening a standardised development environment, creating and accessing your [Daytona Workspaces](/usage/workspaces) based on git repositories. It offers convenient [workspace](/usage/workspaces) management, profile control, and instant team information access -- all directly within VS Code, removing the hassle of going to a web browser, opening the Daytona URL and creating projects upon initial configuration. 



## Prerequisites

Before you can harness the full potential of Daytona's VS Code extension, make sure you meet the following prerequisites to allow a smooth installation process:

- **Visual Studio Code**: have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed on your computer. 

- **Daytona Installation**: Daytona's power lies in its infrastructure. If you haven't set it up yet, you can easily do so by [downloading it from the Daytona installer](https://github.com/daytonaio/installer) on your infrastructure.

- **Daytona Dashboard URL**: To complete the setup, you'll need the URL of your Daytona dashboard, which you can obtain by running [Daytona installer](https://github.com/daytonaio/installer).

_With these prerequisites in place, you'll be ready to set up Daytona's VS Code extension._


## How to install

Installing the Daytona VS Code extension is simple. You have two options to choose from to get started:

### Establish a connection

When you are using the VS Code extension for the first time, you will need to establish a secure connection between your local computer and your Daytona instance. Having this connection in place is essential whenever you are using the Daytona VS Code extension in the future, it keeps your workspaces, profiles and teams to sync with your Daytona installation. We will walk you through it step by step, and you will need your **[Daytona dashboard URL](#prerequisite)** before we continue.

<span class="content-subtitle not-content">

## Features

In this section, we'll cover the essential functionalities of the Daytona VS Code extension. The functionalities are comparable with what you were able to achieve in the Daytona dashboard, be it creating, managing workspaces, managing teams, or viewing profiles. 

These features are designed to simplify your development process, allowing for ease of cloud-based development environment creation based on repositories from git providers and synchronization, viewing team information, and creating profiles. 

### Creating workspaces

Each [workspace](/usage/workspaces) created is isolated in its environment, even if they are based on the same repository. In the following two sub-sections, we will talk about how to create and manage your workspaces with Daytona in VS Code.

 - **Create a workspace in VS Code**: To create a workspace, first you will need to click on the `+` button when you hover over the **Workspace** tab.

 - **Repository URL**: You will be asked for a repository URL. On Github, you can obtain this URL by clicking on the green button `< >`(Clone, open or download), choosing `Local` -> `Clone` via HTTPS on your repository page, copying the URL displayed, or adding `.git` after your repository's URL string.

 - **Select SSH config file**: Within VS Code, you will also be asked "Select an SSH config file", select the first option that appears in the format of `/User/name/.ssh/config`, this question will be asked whenever you open a workspace.

 - **Checking workspaces**: Once the workspace is created, you can see them under `WORKSPACES` in the Daytona VS Code extension tab. We will talk about how to manage them in the next part. 

 - **Choosing templates**: At the moment, if you want to create a workspace with a preset template (ex: You are developing a [Go](https://go.dev/) project and prefer to have [Golang](https://go.dev/) related dependencies set up in the environment, you will need to go to your Daytona dashboard in the `Workspaces` tab and choose one of the templates). But if you have a `devcontainer.json` file that describes the specifics of your development environment, they will be set up as specified whenever you are creating, or opening a workspace.


### Managing workspaces

- **Synchronisation**: All the workspaces under **[WORKSPACES](/usage/workspace)** section within the Daytona extension tab are synchronised with your Daytona dashboard. Whether you are creating a workspace in the Daytona dashboard(by pressing `Create` on the `WORKSPACES` tab) to import a repository from git providers, or in Daytona VS Code extension(click `+` on `WORKSPACES`), they will all sync together under the same team. 

- **Opening workspaces**: You can hover on top of the selected workspace's name and click on the <Icon icon="arrow-right" class="icon-display" color="black" strokeWidth="0.1"/> button, or right-click on the workspace to select `Open` from the dropdown menu. It will start building the development container remotely. You will be able to work on it upon finishing. If you want to open this workspace in a new window, click on the <Icon icon="new-folder" class="icon-display" color="black" strokeWidth="0.1"/>button when you hover on top of a workspace, or right-click on a workspace and select `Open in New Window`. 

- **Connecting via SSH**: Alternatively, if you want to connect to a workspace via SSH, you can start a workspace on the Daytona dashboard(select the workspace, click on `𓈓` and select `Start` on the dropdown menu), select the workspace and click on `

- **Copy ID**: The same repositories might be created under different environments in different workspaces, and if they are using the same name, it will become confusing to recognise for you or your team members. To take notes of different workspaces, right-click on one of them and click `Copy ID`. Your workspace's ID will always be in the format of `your-repository-name + random string`.

- **Stopping a workspace**: Right-click on the workspace and select `Stop`, it will stop a workspace(its environment) and the remote connection with your Daytona instance. When you need to come back and work on it again, you need to click `Open`.

:::caution
- **Destroy a workspace**: When you right-click on a workspace and select `Destroy`, this behavior is irreversible. It deletes the workspace and removes the development container completely. If you have a previous installation or set up that wasn't specified in [devcontainer.json](https://www.daytona.io/dotfiles/guide-create-devcontainer-json-file), you will lose them. When you recreate a workspace from the same repository, you will have to set them up or reinstall them. 
:::

### Managing teams
Workspaces are separated between teams. Workspaces created within a team only exist in that team. If you create a new team, the `WORKSPACES` will appear empty. 

- **Team information**: Within the Daytona extension tab, you can see your team's name under `TEAMS`.

- **Creating a team**: At the moment you can only create new teams on your Daytona dashboard. 

- **Selecting a team**: If you want to change a team -- hover over a team's name, and click on the `Select` button. Note that if you change a team, you won't see the same workspace from the previous team.
{/* need more information related to selecting a team */}


### Managing profiles

Profiles are equivalent to a fresh, new Daytona instance installation, however, if you change your profile without changing teams, workspaces created associated with that profile will appear the same under `WORKSPACES` section. But they are indeed being created in different environments when you open them.

- **Checking a profile**: Under the `PROFILES` section within the extension, you can check your existing profile. `API URL`, `Auth URL`, `SSH Port`， and `Notification URL` are displayed under each profile.
{/*TODO: Ask Toma will user have anything to do with them*/}

- **Selecting a profile**: If you want to change your profile, you can do so by hovering over your profile's name and choosing `Select`, when you open a workspace under the `WORKSPACE` section after choosing a new profile, your workspaces will be opened in different environments. Different from clicking on `Destroy` on a workspace, the previous installation and dependencies within the same workspace will persist.
{/*TODO: Tested it is like this, confirm with Toma if this is expected.*/}

### Shareable Live Preview Link
You can create a shareable live preview link using Daytona's VS Code extension to share a link to others without [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), whenever you are developing an application. If HMR(hot module reload) is enabled, the shareable link will also reload instantly on other remote machines. Note that whoever uses the link will need to be able to sign in to the same Daytona dashboard URL. 


:::note 
This feature currently doesn't support webhook consumption.
:::

To create a shareable live preview link, you will need Daytona's VS Code extension installed within a workspace. We will walk you through it step by step below. Before we start, make sure you have gone through the [installation guide](#how-to-install) and know how to [open a workspace](#managing-workspaces) above. 

<span class="content-subtitle">
1. **Starting a workspace**: To start a workspace, hover under one of the workspaces under the `WORKSPACES` section and click on `→` or the file icon. You will also need to sign in to your Daytona dashboard and grant permissions if you haven't done so.
</span>

<span class="content-subtitle">
2. **Install Daytona extension**: Within the opened workspace(where you should be seeing `<repository-name> [SSH:<workspace-id>.ssh.<dashboard-url>:30000]` on top of the editor groups, indicating you are connected to a workspace), you will need to install the Daytona extension following the [installation](#how-to-install) guide. To confirm the installation is successful in this workspace, check if you can see `DAYTONA PORTS` next to the `TERMINAL` and `PORTS` tab in the panel section(below the editor group). This button will only show when you are working and connected to a workspace.
<VscodePanel/>


</span>

<span class="content-subtitle">
3. **Starting a port**: Depending on your application, you will need to run `npm run dev` or `pnpm run dev` to start a local development server. When the port is opened, two notifications will pop up for a **local live preview**: 
</span>
<VscodeNotification notification="Port 4321 is now available." source="Daytona (Extension)" />
<VscodeNotification notification="Your application running on port 4321 is available" notificationLink="See all forwarded ports"/>

   - **Local preview link**: If you click on `Open in Browser` it will open the live preview link in your default browser, or you can open it within the editor by clicking `Preview in Editor`. 
   - **Shareable preview link**: On the notification that shows `Source: Daytona (Extension)`, click on `Open in Browser` button and your default browser will open with a shareable link, or you can open it in the editor by clicking on `Preview in Editor`. 
:::tip 
   By default, whoever opens this link will need to sign in to your Daytona dashboard URL to access it, until you make the URL public. We will walk you through how to do so in the next step in **DAYTONA PORTS**.
:::
   - **Configure trusted domain**: Upon the first time, you might be asked "Do you want Code to open the external website?". The available options are `Open`, `Copy`, `Configure Trusted Domains`. If you'd prefer the website to be opened every time, you can click on `Configure Trusted Domains`. VS Code will then prompt you for several options to choose from. If you prefer all the applications developed on this Daytona installation to be opened automatically whenever you click on `Open in Browser`,  select `Trust all <your-dashboard-url> and all its subdomains`. If you only want to auto-open the application you are currently working on in the browser, select the option `Trust https://<port>-<workspace-id>.<dashboard-url>`
 

<span class="content-subtitle">
4. **DAYTONA PORTS**: In case you forget to click on the popup notification and miss the link, you can also click on the `DAYTONA PORTS` after the port is opened locally, and you should see the public address of the port.

### Connect via SSH

Using the [SSH protocol(Secure Shell Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell), you can connect and authenticate to your Daytona installation without supplying your username and personal access token at each visit. When you set up SSH, you will need to generate a new private SSH key and add it to the SSH agent, or check for existing SSH keys. You must also add the public SSH key to your Daytona dashboard before you use the key to authenticate or connect to your Daytona installation.


The supported SSH keys for Daytona connections begin with: 
- `ssh-rsa`
- `ssh-dss`
- `ssh-ed25519`
- `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`
- `ecdsa-sha2-nistp384`
- `ecdsa-sha2-nistp521`

:::caution
Only workspaces that are `Started` can be connected via SSH. To `Start` a workspace, you can either right-click on the selected workspace on the Daytona VS Code extension tab and select `Start`, or go to your Daytona dashboard to select a workspace, click on `𓈓` and select `Start` on the dropdown menu.
::: 

On the Daytona dashboard, you can add multiple SSH keys. All the SSH keys added will be used in all your workspaces and help different computers of yours connect to workspaces via SSH. In this section, we will walk you through how to connect to your Daytona Installation via SSH in VS Code. 


<span class="content-subtitle">
1. **Find existing SSH keys**: Open the terminal, and enter the below command to see if existing SSH keys are present.

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh/*.pub

```
- This command will return all your public SSH key's location.
The suffix `pub` at the end of the file path indicates this is a public key.
</span>
:::tip
If you receive an error that `~/.ssh` doesn't exist, you do not have an existing SSH pair in the default location. You can create a new SSH key pair in the [next step: Generate SSH Key](#generate-ssh-key).
:::

- **Copy SSH Key**: Use <Keyboard shortcuts={["Ctrl ^", "C"]}/> to copy one of the returned paths and then use <Keyboard shortcuts={["Ctrl ^", "V"]}/> to run this command in your terminal and also pasting the returned path:


<Tabs>
<TabItem label="MacOS">
```bash
cat <path-from-preview-step>
# Example: cat ~/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Windows">
```bash
type <path-from-preview-step>
# Example: type ~/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Where USERNAME is the name of your user
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

- This command will return your public SSH key. Copy it and save it to somewhere safe and you can continue to [Step 3: Adding SSH key to Daytona dashboard](#add-ssh-to-dashboard) below.


<span class="content-subtitle" id="generate-ssh-key">
2. **Generating SSH Keys**
</span>
- In the previous step, if you happen to not have an SSH key on your local machine, you can generate a new SSH key on your local machine. 

- Open your terminal and paste the text below, replacing the email used in the example with the same email address you used with the [identity provider](/installation/idps) you have used for your Daytona installation.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
:::note 
If you are using a legacy sytem that doesn't support the `ed25519` algorithm, use: 
```bash
 ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
:::

- This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label. You will see the command line shows you: 
```bash
> Generating public/private rsa key pair.
> Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM): [Press enter]
```
- **Copy public key path**: When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key", you can press Enter to accept the default file location. An example return will look like: 
```bash
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copy your public key path:     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:rjelabgiaebrnlakdlkrjelkanrjeiagoirjadnkfjire your_email@example.com
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|           . C+++|
|            *...o|
|            .D.+.|
|      .  =.  .=.o|
|     o =S..o. .oo|
|    . S = ..o o+=|
|   o + =     . .o|
|    +        . .=|
|              oo=|
+----[SHA256]-----+
```


- **Passphrase**: At the prompt, you will be asked to type a secure **passphrase**. You can either leave it empty or enter a passphrase for your SSH keys to prevent some edge cases (ex: Your computer is stolen and attackers can gain access to every system that uses that key)

> If you choose to enter a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter the passphrase when you use your key for the first time. If you choose to save the passphrase with your keychain, you won't have to enter it again. 

- **Copy your SSH key:** Once you have your public key path from the previous step, in your terminal, run

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="MacOS">

```bash
cat <path-from-preview-step>
# Example: cat ~/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Example return: ssh
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Windows">

```bash
type <path-from-preview-step>
# Example: type ~/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Where USERNAME is the name of your user
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

- After running this command, an example output will contain three parts. First is the algorithm used to generate your SSH key, the second part is a long, encrypted result of your SSH key ending with `==`, and the third part is the email you used to generate your SSH key. 
```bash
ssh-rsa LongRandomStringWithSlash/slash/randomString== your_email@example.com
## This is a much shorter example, real id_rsa.pub output is a lot longer
```
- **Copy the full returned result** and move to the next step. 


<span id="add-ssh-to-dashboard" class="content-subtitle">
3. **Adding SSH key to Daytona dashboard**
</span>

- **Navigate to the `SSH Keys` page**: On your Daytona dashboard, select the `SSH Keys` tab on the left side of the panel. On this page, click on `Add`. 
- **Add SSH Key**: After clicking on `Add`, you will see a popup window with three input fields, `Name`, `Key`, and `Expiration Date`. 

<table class="container vscode-panel-explain">
<tr>
<th>Input Field</th>
<th>Usage</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Name</td>
<td>Required input. You can create a unique name in this field and it is not correlated to the value of the key. This field will be displayed on the `SSH Keys` page to help you recognise which key was added. Recommend naming it by machine name, user name, and algorithm for better recognition, ex: `MacOs-James-rsa`.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Key</td>
<td>Required input. This is the field to paste in the SSH key you have copied from the previous step. <b>Make sure you copy it from the start `ssh-rsa` to the end `your_email@email.com`.</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Expiration Date</td>
<td>Optional input. If your organisation requires you to [rotate your SSH keys](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#272-rotation) with a certain expiration date, you can set it here and it will expire timely. </td>
</tr>
</table>

<span class="content-subtitle" id="obtain-ssh-connection">
4. **Obtain SSH Connection Command**
</span>
- Within your Daytona dashboard, navigate to the `WORKSPACES` tab, select a workspace and click on `𓈓`, select `Start` on the dropdown menu to make sure the workspace is up and running. 
- Again on the same dropdown menu, select `Connect via SSH`. The browser will open a popup window with the title `Connect to <workspace-id> via SSH`. You have two options below: `Public Key` and `Access Token`. Copy the value under the tab `Public Key`. 

<span class="content-subtitle">
5. **Connect Via SSH in VS Code**
</span>
- **Install `Remote - SSH` Extension**: To connect via SSH in VS Code, you need to make sure you have the extension `Remote - SSH` installed on your VS Code. You can either navigate to the extension tab in VS Code or use the shortcut keys to open the Extension tab:  
<Table>
<TableRow contents="Windows :" >
<Keyboard shortcuts={["Ctrl ^", "Shift ⇧", "X"]} slot="html"/>
</TableRow>
<TableRow contents="MacOS: ">
<Keyboard shortcuts={["Command ⌘", "Shift ⇧", "X"]} slot="html"/>
</TableRow>
</Table>

 - Or download it from the `Remote - SSH` extension via browser through [URL link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)


:::note
If you already installed the Daytona VS Code extension, `Remote - SSH` extension is already been installed on your VS Code as it is one of the dependencies. 
:::
- After installation, you should be able to see the `Remote Explorer` icon <Icon icon="vscode-remote-explorer" color="black" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="icon-display" strokeWidth="0.1"/> on the left panel within VS Code. If you are not seeing it, right-click on the panel, on the dropdown menu, select `Remote Explorer` to display the tab on the panel.  

- **Remotes (Tunnel/SSH)**: While the `Remote Explore` tab is opened, make sure the type of Remote Explorer is set to `Remotes (Tunnel/SSH)` (The dropdown menu next to `REMOTE EXPLORER`)

- **Adding connection**: Hover on top of the section `SSH` under `REMOTES (TUNNEL/SSH)`, you should see a <Icon icon="vscode-add" color="black" class="icon-display" strokeWidth="0.1"/> icon. Click on that icon, and you should see a prompt for input `Enter SSH Connection Command` on the top of VS Code. Paste the value you obtained from the last step, [obtain SSH Connection Command](#obtain-ssh-connection) and press enter. 

- **Select SSH Config file**: Next, you will be prompted to `Select an SSH configuration file to update`, then select the first configuration file that looks like `/Users/username/.ssh/config`. 

- **Open workspace folder**: After selecting the configuration file, a new VS Code window will open. By default, after you connect to a Daytona workspace, you are located in the root of the workspace. If you hit <Keyboard shortcuts={["Command ⌘", "O"]}/> or click on `Open Folder` under the `File Explorer` tab, you will see all the files, including dotfiles in this workspace, and a prompt asking for directory's path. To open the files you need to work on, type in `/workspaces/repository-name` to enter the folder by hitting keyboard <Keyboard shortcuts="Enter ⏎"/> or click on `OK` on the right side of the prompt. 

_After the steps above, you established an SSH connection with your Daytona installation and are ready to work in this workspace._


## Clean Uninstall Guide

After installing the Daytona VS Code extension, there might be a point when you update your Daytona instance's installation, or you want to start over the installation process again after a clean uninstall, here are several steps to help you start fresh again: 


### Uninstall Daytona VS Code extension

In VS Code, navigate to the Extension tab or use the shortcut keys:

<Table>
<TableRow contents="Windows :" >
<Keyboard shortcuts={["Ctrl ^", "Shift ⇧", "X"]} slot="html"/>
</TableRow>
<TableRow contents="MacOS: ">
<Keyboard shortcuts={["Command ⌘", "Shift ⇧", "X"]} slot="html"/>
</TableRow>
</Table>

Search for `Daytona` in the extension marketplace, select the extension with our logo, and click on the button `Uninstall` on the `Extensions: Daytona` tab that shows up. This will only remove the extension within VS Code, for a clean uninstall you will need to continue to the next step.


### Remove Daytona-related files

{/* TODO: confirm with Daytona if all the config files moved to ~/.ssh/daytona_config */}

1. **Remove SSH configuration entries**:
To remove Daytona-specific entries from your SSH configuration without deleting the entire file, you will need to manually edit the file:

   a. **Open the SSH configuration file in a text editor**:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.ssh/config
   ```

   :::tip
   If you use [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/), you might notice that your mouse is not working here and that's **expected in a terminal**. You can only move cursor around with arrow keys <Keyboard shortcuts="←"/> <Keyboard shortcuts="→"/> <Keyboard shortcuts="↑"/> <Keyboard shortcuts="↓"/> , and delete content using <Keyboard shortcuts="Delete"/> key.
   :::

   Or if you prefer using VS Code as your editor:
   
   ```bash
   code ~/.ssh/config
   ```

   b. **Find content related to Daytona**: Locate the `Host` entries related to Daytona, which might be marked with comments, starting with `# START DAYTONA` and ending with `# END DAYTONA`. <u>Carefully remove only those lines related to Daytona.</u>
