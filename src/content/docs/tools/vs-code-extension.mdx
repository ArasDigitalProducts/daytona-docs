## What is Daytona's VS Code extension

Daytona's VS Code extension integrates Visual Studio Code, appearing as a tab on the left-hand side alongside your default tabs in VS Code like File Explorer, Search, Source Control etc, to streamline your worklow and boost productivity.

The extension allows you to have a frictionless experience of opening a standardised development environment, creating and accessing your [Daytona Workspaces](/usage/workspaces) based on git repositories. It offers convenient [workspace](/usage/workspaces) management, profile control, and instant team information access -- all directly within VS Code, removing the hassle of going to a web browser, open Daytona URL and creating projects upon initial configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before you can harness the full potential of Daytona's VS Code extension, make sure you meet the following prerequisites to allow a smooth installation process:

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**: have Visual Studio Code installed on your computer. 

- **Daytona Installation**: Daytona's power lies in its infrastructure. If you haven't set it up yet, you can easily do so by [downloading it from the Daytona installer](https://github.com/daytonaio/installer) on your infrastructure.

- **Daytona Dashboard URL**: To complete the setup, you'll need the URL of your Daytona dashboard, which you can obtain from running [Daytona installer](https://github.com/daytonaio/installer).

_With these prerequisites in place, you'll be ready to set up Daytona's VS Code extension._

### Establish a connection

When you are using the VS Code extension for the first time, you will need to establish a secure connection between your local computer and your Daytona instance. Having this connection in place is essential whenever you are using Daytona VS Code extension in the future, it keeps your workspaces, profiles and teams sync with your Daytona installation. We will walk you through it step by step, and you will need your **[Daytona dashboard URL](#prerequisite)** before we continue.

1. **Sign in to dashboard and select a [workspace](/usage/workspaces)**

   - Visit your Daytona dashboard URL and make sure you are on the `Workspaces` tab.
   
   - Select one of the workspaces and click on the `ìàì` icon on it.
   - Under the dropdown menu, select `Open`.

   - After you selected `Open`, choose `VS Code` as your code editor in the pop up modal (You may choose others, but in this guide we will need VS Code). And then click on the green button `Open` on the pop up window with title "Open \<your-selected-workspace's-name\>".

3. **Respond to permissions**

   - As you proceed, you may encounter the following prompts within VS Code:

     - "The extension 'Daytona' wants to sign in using \<your-profile-name\>." Choose the blue button with `Allow`.
     
     - "Do you want Code to open the external website?" Choose `Open`.

4. **Authenticate Daytona with Your Git provider**

   - In the browser pop-up window that appears with `id.<your-daytona-url>`, under "Please re-authenticate to continue," click on your Git provider.

5. **Open Visual Studio Code**

   - In your browser, the pop-up will prompt "id.\<your-daytona-url\> wants to open "Visual Studio Code"," choose `Open 'Visual Studio Code'` or `Always open 'Visual Studio Code'`.

6. **Allow Daytona Extension**

   - When VS Code is opened, you will be asked, "Allow 'Daytona' extension to open this URI?" Choose the blue button `Open`.
   
7. **Select SSH Configuration File**

   - Finally, in your VS Code, when prompted to "Select the SSH config file to update," choose the first option, usually in the format of `/User/name/.ssh/config`.

## Features

In this section, we'll cover the essential functionalities of the Daytona VS Code extension. The functionalities are comparable with what you able to achieve in Daytona dashboard, be it creating, managing workspaces, managing teams, viewing profiles. 

These features are designed to simplify your development process, allowing for ease of cloud-based development environment creation based on repositories from git providers and synchronization, viewing team information and creating profiles. 

### Creating workspaces

Each [workspace](/usage/workspaces) created is isolated in their own environment, even if they are based on the same repository. In the following two sub-sections, we will talk about how to create and manage your workspaces with Daytona in VS Code.

 - **Create a workspace in VS Code**: To create a workspace, first you will need to click on the `+` button when you hover over the **Workspace** tab.

 - **Repository URL**: You will be asked for a repository URL. On Github, you can obtain this URL by clicking on the green button `< >`(Clone, open or download), choose `Local` -> `Clone` via HTTPS on your repository page, and copy the URL displayed, or adding `.git` after your repository's URL string.

 - **Select SSH config file**: Within VS Code, you will also be asked "Select an SSH config file", select the first option appear in the format of `/User/name/.ssh/config`, this question will be asked whenver you open a workspace.

 - **Checking workspaces**: Once the workspace is created, you can see them under `WORKSPACES` in the Daytona VS Code extension tab. We will talk about how to manage them in the next part. 

 - **Choosing templates**: At the moment, if you want to create a workspace with a preset template (ex: You are developing a [Go](https://go.dev/) project and prefer to have [Golang](https://go.dev/) related dependencies set up in the environment, you will need to go to your Daytona dashboard in the `Workspaces` tab and choose one of the templates). But if you have a `devcontainer.json` file describes the specific of your development environment, they will be set up as specified whenever you are creating, or opening a workspace.


### Managing workspaces

- **Synchronisation**: All the workspaces under **[WORKSPACES](/usage/workspace)** section within Daytona extension tab are synchronised with your Daytona dashboard. Whether you are creating a workspace in the Daytona dashboard(by pressing `Create` on `WORKSPACES` tab) to import a repository from git providers, or in Daytona VS Code extension(click `+` on `WORKSPACES`), they will all sync together under the same team. 

- **Opening workspaces**: You can hover on top of the selected workspace's name and click on `‚û°Ô∏è`, or right click on the workspace to select `Open` from the dropdown menu. It will start building the development container remotely. You will be able to work on it upon finishing. If you want to open this workspace in a new window, click on `

- **Copy ID**: The same repositories might be created under different environment in different workspaces, and if they are using the same name, it will become confusing to recognise for you or your team members. To take notes of different workspaces, right click on one of them and click `Copy ID`. Your workspace's ID will always be in the format of `your-repository-name + random string`.

- **Stopping a workspace**: Right click on the workspace and select `Stop`, it will stop a workspace(its environment) and the remote connection with your Daytona instance. When you need to come back and work on it again, you need to click `Open`.

:::caution
- **Destroy a workspace**: When you right click on a workspace and select `Destroy`, this behavior is irreversible. It deletes the workspace and removes the development container completely. If you have a previous installation or set up that wasn't specified in [devcontainer.json](https://www.daytona.io/dotfiles/guide-create-devcontainer-json-file), you will lose them. When you recreate a workspace from the same repository, you will have to set them up, or reinstall them. 
:::

### Managing teams
Workspaces are separated between teams. Workspaces created within a team only exists in that team. If you create a new team, the `WORKSPACES` will appear empty. 

- **Team information**: Within the Daytona extension tab, you can see your team's name under `TEAMS`.

- **Creating a team**: At the moment you can only create new teams on your Daytona dashboard. 

- **Selecting a team**: If you want to change a team -- hover over a team's name, and click on the `Select` button. Note that if you change a team, you won't see the same workspace from the previous team.
{/* need more information related to selecting a team */}


### Managing profiles

Profiles are equivalent to a fresh, new Daytona instance installation, however if you change your profile without changing teams, workspaces' created associate to that profile will appear the same under `WORKSPACES` section. But they are indeed being created in different environment when you open them.

- **Checking a profile**: Under the `PROFILES` section within the extension, you can check your existing profile. `API URL`, `Auth URL`, `SSH Port` and `Notification URL` are displayed under each profile.
{/*TODO: Ask Toma will user have anything to do with them*/}

- **Selecting a profile**: If you want to change your profile, you can do so by hovering over your profile's name and choosing `Select`, when you open a workspace under the `WORKSPACE` section after choosing a new profile, your workspaces will be opened in different environments. Different from clicking on `Destroy` on a workspace, the previous installation and dependencies within the same workspace will persist.
{/*TODO: Tested it is like this, confirm with Toma if this is expected.*/}



## Clean Uninstall Guide

After installing Daytona VS Code extension, there might be a point when you update your Daytona instance's installation, or you want to start over the installation process again after a clean uninstall, here are several steps to help you to start fresh again: 


### Uninstall Daytona VS Code extension

In VS Code, navigate to the Extension tab or use the shortcut keys:

- Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+X`
- MacOS: `Command+Shift+X`

And search for `Daytona` in the extension marketplace, select the extension with our logo and click on the button `Uninstall` on the `Extensions:Daytona` tab that shows up. This will only remove the extension within VS Code, for a clean uninstall you will need to continue to the next step.


### Remove Daytona related files

1. **Remove SSH configuration entries**:
To remove Daytona-specific entries from your SSH configuration without deleting the entire file, you will need to manually edit the file:

   a. **Open the SSH configuration file in a text editor**:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.ssh/config
   ```

   :::tip
   If you use [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/), you might notice that you mouse is not working here and that's **expected in a terminal**. You can only move cursor around with arrow keys ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è, and delete content using `Delete` key.
   :::

   Or if you prefer using VS Code as your editor:
   
   ```bash
   code ~/.ssh/config
   ```

   b. **Find content related to Daytona**: Locate the `Host` entries related to Daytona, which might be marked with comments, starting with `# START DAYTONA` and ending with `# END DAYTONA`. <u>Carefully remove only those lines related to Daytona.</u>

   c. **Save changes**: Save the changes and close the text editor.

   :::caution
   Be cautious not to remove other SSH configurations that are unrelated to Daytona, as they may be important for your other remote connections.
   :::


2. **Remove profile related data**

   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.daytona
   ```

   This command will remove the directory which we store your profile, default configurations, which url and redirect url to open when you are granting permission to connect local VS Code to Daytona. 
   

_After these two steps, you will have a clean set up and have removed all files that are related to Daytona on your computer. However, if you are looking to uninstall and clean up your Daytona deployment, check [this uninstallation guide](/installation/uninstall)._
